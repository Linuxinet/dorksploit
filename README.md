## DORKSPLOIT
**Dorksploit Google Hacking Dork Scraping and Searching Script**

Dorksploit is a script I made in python 3. With this tool, you can easily find Google Dorks. Dorksploit collects potentially vulnerable web pages and applications on the Internet or other awesome info that is picked up by Google's search bots.

You can save the output in a file so that you can view it at a later time. You can determine the number of searches yourself. The number of websites to display

You can also use Dorks Eye as a command-line interface (CLI) to quickly search through Google. Dorks Eye shows only the links, without advertising, and is and is also fast.

But be careful not to overdo it, otherwise, you have a chance that If you perform too many requests over a short period, Google will start to throw captchas at you. This is annoying and will limit how much or how fast you do the search.
